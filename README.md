# ESP32-S3 FPV Drone Camera

This project transforms an ESP32-S3 with an OV2640 camera into a high-performance FPV (First-Person View) drone camera, streaming smooth, full-screen video over Wi-Fi. It features a stable 30 FPS MJPEG stream, a robust Wi-Fi access point, and a comprehensive serial command interface for real-time diagnostics and control.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **High-Quality 30 FPS Video Stream:** Delivers a smooth and stable video feed, optimized for FPV applications.
- **MJPEG Streaming Server:** Utilizes an efficient MJPEG server to stream video directly to any web browser.
- **Full-Screen Display:** The HTML interface is designed to display the video stream in full-screen, dynamically adjusting to any screen size for an immersive experience.
- **Wi-Fi Access Point:** Creates its own Wi-Fi network, allowing for a direct and reliable connection without external routers.
- **Dual-Core Architecture:** Leverages both cores of the ESP32-S3 for maximum performance, dedicating one core to video processing and the other to network operations.
- **Interactive Serial Console:** Provides a rich set of commands for real-time debugging, status monitoring, and configuration changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware & Software

### Hardware

- **Board:** 4D Systems GEN4-ESP32 (ESP32-S3R8N16) or a compatible ESP32-S3 board with PSRAM.
- **Camera:** OV2640 Camera Module.

### Software

- **Framework:** Arduino
- **IDE:** PlatformIO
- **Libraries:**
  - `espressif/esp32-camera`: For camera interfacing.
  - `WebServer`: For the MJPEG streaming server.
  - `WiFi`: For creating the access point.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PlatformIO IDE Extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)

### Installation & Upload

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO installed.
3.  Connect your ESP32-S3 board to your computer.
4.  Build and upload the firmware using the PlatformIO "Upload" task.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Power On:** After uploading the firmware, power on your ESP32-S3 board.
2.  **Connect to Wi-Fi:** On your computer or mobile device, connect to the Wi-Fi network with the following credentials:
    - **SSID:** `ESP32-S3_Drone_30fps`
    - **Password:** `drone2024`
3.  **View Stream:** Open a web browser and navigate to the following address:
    - **URL:** `http://192.168.4.1`

The video stream will appear, filling the entire browser window.

## üíª Serial Commands
